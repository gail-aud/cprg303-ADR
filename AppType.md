Decision: Native app

Rationale: By creating a native app, we can take use of all the features offered by the target platforms (iOS and Android) and offer a smooth user experience. Additionally, native applications operate better and have access to device-specific capabilities, which is essential for a retail app with push notifications and offline mode.

Result: May require more development effort and resources, but will result in a better user experience and more features. The team will need to maintain separate code bases for each platform and certify compatibility with various operating system and device versions.
