Decision: Users will have to be asked for permissions required by the app's functions, such as access to the camera for product scanning, location access for delivery tracking,, and notification permissions for push notifications.

Rationale: The software will be able to offer the needed features and functionality if users are asked for their approval. User privacy must be taken into account, and only permissions needed for the app's major features should be requested.

Status: Planned

Result: In order to improve app speed and user experience, the development team may employ analytics to track user behaviour, pinpoint areas for improvement, and make data-driven decisions. Improved app performance, user experience, and decision-making based on data-driven insights and metrics are the outcomes of choosing an analytics tool or service.
