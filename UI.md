Decision: Use a cross-platform user interface framework like Reactive Native or Flutter to build the app

Rationale: We can create a code once and distribute it to multiple platforms. The user experience and performance will still be similar to native, saving time and effort during development.

Status: Planned

Result: Improved development speed, code reuse, and the ability to create a uniform user interface and user experience across several platforms are the outcomes of adopting a cross-platform UI framework.
